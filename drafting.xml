<!--

this is a mix of ruby shell irb input and the xml output I've
generated with the ruby gem "ox" as per the
instructions in bookworm.rb to parse "pmceutilsxml"

Trying to work out the way to retrieve corresponding author
from the minority of papers in my list which have a PubMed Central 
record (which highlights the corresponding author/s in the xml)

The example used for testing this code is in row 6 of my spreadsheet,
http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?id=PMC1637560&db=pmc

To recreate my error, follow this code in Ruby :

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

require "ox"
require "active_support/core_ext/hash"
require "net/http"

url = http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?id=PMC1637560&db=pmc

xml_data = Net::HTTP.get_response(URI.parse(url)).body
data = Hash.from_xml(xml_data)

puts data['pmc_articleset']['article']['front'] # this works (digs into the XML tree)

puts data['pmc_articleset']['article']['front']['article-meta'] # this gives n o t h i n g

xibility of double stranded nucleic acids and the nature of their deformed confo
rmations induced by external forces is important for a wide range of biological
processes including transcriptional regulation, supercoil and catenane removal,
and site-specific recombination. We present, at atomic resolution, a simulation
of the dynamics involved in the transitions from B-DNA and A-RNA to Pauling (P)
forms and to denatured states driven by application of external torque and tensi
on. We then calculate the free energy profile along a B- to P-transition coordin
ate and from it, compute a reversible pathway, i.e., an isotherm of tension and
torque pairs required to maintain P-DNA in equilibrium. The reversible isotherm
maps correctly onto a phase diagram derived from single molecule experiments, an
d yields values of elongation, twist, and twist-stretch coupling in agreement wi
th measured values. We also show that configurational entropy compensates signif
icantly for the large electrostatic energy increase due to closer-packed P backb
ones. A similar set of simulations applied to RNA are used to predict a novel st
ructure, P-RNA, with its associated free energy, equilibrium tension, torque and
 structural parameters, and to assign the location, on the phase-diagram, of a p
utative force\u2013torque-dependent RNA \u201Ctriple point.\u201D"}, "kwd_group"
